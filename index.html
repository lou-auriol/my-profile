      <h1>Hello, I'm Lou ⭐️</h1>
     <img src="images/profile-picture.png" class="img-circle" width="100px" alt="Lou Auriol">
     <p>I am a student at ESSEC business school ! I love cooking, sports and meeting new people. I am a sporty and dynamic person. I am also very sensitive and an overthinker. By the way, I am from Bordeaux (and I love this city), but I am currently living in Cergy. I really like using Pinterest for inspirations about recipes, outfits, decorations stuffs, etc. </p>

     <h2>Sport 🏉</h2>
     <p>I really love sport! I like running in the moring listening good music, and going to the gym (which I have start since my entry at ESSEC). Moreover I have been a <em>rubyplayer </em> for 3 years now. I have been playing in a Bordeaux rugby club but currently, I am playing at ERTT : the feminine essec rugby team ! Sport make me feel good and allows me to exteriorize my feelings.</p>

     <h2>Languages 🌍</h2>
     <p>I really enjoy speaking foreign languages! I love speaking english and use this language to <em>meet new people</em> and <em>travel</em> all aroud the world. I would like to live in Australia someday. I already had the occasion to live in New-Zealand for a few month in a host-family when I was 14 years old and I simply loved it. I am not bilingual yet, but trust me.. I will! I also speak spanish and a bit of chinese! </p>
